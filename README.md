# User story 

As the Hotel manager, I want to use a dashboard to see if the hotel has been makig profits or lossess for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020. I also want to know if we should increase our parking lot size to accommodate customers with cars if there is a trend im customers with cars. I want to see other trends of data that I might have missed out. 

This dashboard should allow me to identify the revenue based on metrics like profit margins. 

With this information, I can make more informed decisions on areas of possible improvements. I will get to see why there has been a drop or an increase to maintain consistency.

## Dashboard components required 
- What should the dashboard contain based on the requirements provided?

To understand what it should contain, we need to figure out what questions we need the dashboard to answer:

1. Who are the top 10 YouTubers with the most subscribers?
2. Which 3 channels have uploaded the most videos?
3. Which 3 channels have the most views?
4. Which 3 channels have the highest average views per video?
5. Which 3 channels have the highest views per subscriber ratio?
6. Which 3 channels have the highest subscriber engagement rate per video uploaded?

For now, these are some of the questions we need to answer, this may change as we progress down our analysis.
